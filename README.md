# irspectrum
This is the repository for the MSU CSC450 IR Spectrum project. This is where we are going 
to keep all of the relevant code, documentation, and other files needed for the project.
I have created this repository, so technically it says this repo belongs to me, but you all
will still be able to commit pull and commit to it because it is set to public. Once you 
all have GitHub accounts, we will work on permissions and other stuff like that to make
it belong to all of us. If you have any questions, feel free to email at:

ram2539@live.missouristate.edu

or once you are in the slack group (https://csc450-irspectrum.slack.com) you can contact 
me in there as well.

Have a nice day,
- Alex Matthews
